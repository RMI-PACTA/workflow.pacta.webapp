# This example file will enable R language checks on push or PR to the main
# branch.
# It will also run the checks every weeknight at midnight UTC
#
# Note the @main in `uses:` on the last line. This will call the latest version
# of the workflow from the `main` brnach in the RMI-PACTA/actions repo. You can
# also specify a tag from that repo, or a commit SHA to pin action versions.
